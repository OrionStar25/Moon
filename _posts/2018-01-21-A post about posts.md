## Let's take a little detour

This post's main purpose is to make you land onto my actual place of writing posts. Even though 

* I love Jekyll
* Writing posts in markdown is magic
* The readability is fabulous and neat

I had started building my profile after I had started blogging. Now its turned out to be a beautiful little space over there (quite literally), and I don't want to disrupt its sanctity :)  Also, its nice to keep this place exclusive for all my projects. Isolation is bliss.

So head over to [My Space](https://stardiariesweb.wordpress.com/). A great amount of secrets dwell here!
