Maybe its the topic that makes me jump straight to the point, but here you see an amalgamation of food and technology â€“ the 2 most widely loved entities of this century.

An enormous amount of credit goes to [Heston Blumenthal](http://www.thefatduck.co.uk/) for combining the former with latter and reating literal magic, but the reverse has been catching on too! Developers have managed to make their technologies and services more appealing by selling it as something weâ€™d like to dive in almost instantly.

Let me give you the most basic example:

Oh, wait, there is one more fundamental than that :
**CHIP**

And while we are into microprocessors, data units are termed as *nibble*, *bit*, *byte*â€¦. Whoaa.

Something for the sweet tooth :

Following suit of these giants, weâ€™re seeing a number of tech startups turning to the grocery shelves for naming ideas in the past couple years. From the dairy aisle, we have **Butter.ai**, a digital personal assistant, and **Cheddar**, an online financial news network that closed a $19 million round this week. Representing the produce section, thereâ€™s **Plum**, an online saving tool. And from the bakery, we have **Bagel Labs**, developer of a smart tape measure, and **Donut Media**, a startup targeting auto enthusiasts.

**Vegan** is an npm library that tells you whether a food item is vegan or not.

Even blockchain caught up to this tasty deed and released [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/), [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/), and [Drizzle](http://truffleframework.com/docs/drizzle/getting-started). But the most exciting thing for me remains the [TruffleCon 2018](http://truffleframework.com/trufflecon2018)!

While the hunger for advanced technology remains a constant, our appetite for scrumptious food names is in equivalence! The point is: These ARE the exciting times we once hoped for.

Or at least itâ€™s definitely a bit of it ðŸ˜€
