Hello friends! Let's start wih the introductions. On formal documents, papers, certificates, etc. I'm known as Niharika Shrivastava. 
On most social platforms I go by the name OrionStar25. Otherwise, don't bother much. Call me Chunnu. 

## Philosophies, any?

The one quote that has really stuck with me through all these years is

> Its always the journey that matters, not the destination.

And I like to have faith in duality ☯ .

## Who are you right now?

I'm a developer in making, greatly enthused by python, C++, and javascript. I am pursuing Bachelors in Information Technology from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. Throw in some musical notes and sick beats and we could be having fun hacking together! :)
Oh also, I'm hilarious. I promise. 

Any messages or tweets coming my way are more than welcome.

## What is this place?

This site is a placeholder for my technical journey. My blogs, projects, and resume profiles will reflect all the related work. I do have another blog which holds a different side of me. Feel free to lurk around a bit longer [there](https://stardiariesweb.wordpress.com/)!
